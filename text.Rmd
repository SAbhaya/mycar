# Data Analysis on My Car fuel

## Introduction

I have gathred most of my refuel data using an app. This analysis is all about fuel consumption and efficieny of differnt fuel  types. 

## Research

An octane rating, or octane number, is a standard measure of the performance of an engine or aviation fuel. 


The piston compresses the fuel and air mix in the combustion chamber of the engine.
Normaly the compressed air and gas mix is ignited by a spark plug. But when that does not happen,  the mixture explodes in the combustion chamber rather than ignited by the spark plug.  This is known as detonatig or knocking and pinging. https://auto.howstuffworks.com/compression-ratio-octane-ratings1.htm


So high performance gasoline engines that require higher copression ratios, use high octane fuels. 
The higher the octane number, the more compression the fuel can withstand before detonating

## Background

I have used four fuel types of this. 

* E10 - regular unleaded petrol blended with between 9% and 10% ethanol.
* 91 - Standard unleaded petrol
* 95 - Premium 95 Octane
* 98 - Premium 98 Octane

Before anaylsing the data, I have made several assumptions.

* Only consider fuel type as varaible and consider other factors remain constant (driving style, weather, type pressure etc.)
* Fuel refil amount = fuel usage for distance travelled after previous fuel refil.


## Data

In order to use for analysis, some header text from the date set have been removed. Also fuel stations names have been replaced with dummy names.

Now we can import the data into R for analysis.

## Code

Load the required packages

```{r pkg, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)

```

Import csv file to R

```{r import, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data <- read_csv("data.csv")
```


select only required columns

changed date to datetime format

add new column for calculated cost.

```{r clean, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}

data2 <- data %>% 
  select(refuelDate, quantity,distance,price,fuel_station,fuel_subtype) %>%
  mutate(refuelDate = date(ymd_hms(refuelDate)), cost = quantity*price/100) %>%
  arrange(refuelDate)

```
