An octane rating, or octane number, is a standard measure of the performance of an engine or aviation fuel. 
The higher the octane number, the more compression the fuel can withstand before detonating (igniting). 
In broad terms, fuels with a higher octane rating are used in high performance gasoline engines that require higher 
compression ratios. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane_rating
