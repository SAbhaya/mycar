An octane rating, or octane number, is a standard measure of the performance of an engine or aviation fuel. 
The higher the octane number, the more compression the fuel can withstand before detonating (igniting). 
In broad terms, fuels with a higher octane rating are used in high performance gasoline engines that require higher 
compression ratios. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane_rating


Fuels such as 95 or 98 RON (octane rating number) have a higher resistance to burn
According to NRMA motoring expert Jack Haley, on average 95 RON can give around 4 per cent lower fuel consumption than 91, assuming the engine computer adjusts to take advantage of the octane difference. https://www.mynrma.com.au/membership/my-nrma-app/fuel-resources/which-octane-petrol-is-best-for-you



To be more specific, a piston compresses the fuel and air mix in the combustion chamber of the engine. And the so-called compression ratio -- and each engine has its own ratio -- refers to just how much of that fuel and air combination the piston compresses. "In a four cylinder, 2-liter engine, each cylinder would have a 500 cc capacity," says John Nielsen, director of approved auto repair with the American Automobile Association (AAA). "As the piston moves down the cylinder, it draws in 500 cc of air and fuel. The valves close and the piston moves up, compressing the 500 cc charge. If that charge is compressed into 50 cc, the compression ratio of the engine would be 10:1."

Remember, under normal circumstances the compressed air and gas mix is ignited by a spark plug. But when that does not happen, and instead the mixture explodes in the combustion chamber rather than being ignited by the spark plug, that is called detonation -- or, as it is more commonly known, knocking and pinging [source: Nielsen].

knock sensors are so-called piezo-electric microphones bolted to the engine block. "The knock detector talks to the ECU [the car's computer], which retards the timing to stop the knock," https://auto.howstuffworks.com/compression-ratio-octane-ratings2.htm

trusty owners' manual and see what you should be doing. If your vehicle requires a high octane rating, the manual will tell you. Otherwise, don't pay the extra 15 to 20 cents per gallon for a higher octane fuel. "Putting high-octane fuel into a car that only needs low-octane fuel is a total waste of money," says Arman.
