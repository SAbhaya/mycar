An octane rating, or octane number, is a standard measure of the performance of an engine or aviation fuel. 
The higher the octane number, the more compression the fuel can withstand before detonating (igniting). 
In broad terms, fuels with a higher octane rating are used in high performance gasoline engines that require higher 
compression ratios. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane_rating


Fuels such as 95 or 98 RON (octane rating number) have a higher resistance to burn
According to NRMA motoring expert Jack Haley, on average 95 RON can give around 4 per cent lower fuel consumption than 91, assuming the engine computer adjusts to take advantage of the octane difference. https://www.mynrma.com.au/membership/my-nrma-app/fuel-resources/which-octane-petrol-is-best-for-you
